    <h2>What Is LAPTOP and Why Is It Important?</h2>
    <p>This is because a laptop allows you to take notes, research and write essays and reports from one standard 
    location. Typing notes can also be quicker than copying by hand, meaning you're able to retain more for 
    studying and future reference.</p>
    <h3>What is LAPTOP</h3>
    <p>Random access memory (RAM) is a computer's short-term memory, where data that the processor is currently
        using is stored temporarily. RAM memory can be accessed much faster than data on a hard disk, SDD, or
        other long-term storage device, which is why RAM capacity is so important for system performance.</p>
    <h3>What does LAPTOP stand for?</h3>
    <p>RAM is short for “random access memory,” and it’s one of the most fundamental elements of computing. RAM
        is a temporary memory bank where your computer stores data it’s currently working on. RAM keeps data
        easily accessible so that it can be retrieved quickly, meaning your processor doesn’t have to go into
        long-term storage to complete immediate processing tasks.</p>
    <h3>What does LAPTOP do?</h3>
    <p>
        RAM is temporary storage that goes away when the power turns off. So what is RAM used for, then? It’s very 
        fast, which makes it ideal for things the computer is actively working on, such as applications that are 
        currently running (for example, the web browser in which you’re reading this article) and the data those applications
        work on or with (such as this article).
    </p>
    <p>It can help to think about RAM with the analogy of a physical desktop. Your working space — where you
        scribble on something immediately — is the top of the desk, where you want everything within arm’s reach
        and you want no delay in finding anything. That’s RAM. In contrast, if you want to keep anything to work
        on later, you put it into a desk drawer — or store it on a hard disk, either locally or in the cloud.

    <h2>What Is RAM and Why Is It Important?</h2>
            <p>None of your programs, files, Netflix streams, or other processes would work without RAM, which is where

                article, we explain what RAM means in computer terms and why it’s so important for smooth, fast
                processing. Then, learn how to optimize your computer’s RAM with a specialized performance booster.</p>

    <h2>What Is MOUSE and Why Is It Important?</h2>
    <p>A mouse is very important because it is the control device for most computer systems. A mouse can be used to select items on a monitor, and to move the cursor around on a screen. What Are The Five Functions Of Mouse? A mouse is a small, fast, and dexterous animal that is used to move around a computer screen. A mouse has five functions.</p>
    <h3>What is MOUSE</h3>
    <p>The mouse, sometimes called a pointer, is a hand-operated input device used to manipulate objects on a computer screen.

    Whether it uses a laser or ball, or the mouse is wired or wireless, a movement detected from the mouse sends instructions to the computer to move the cursor on the screen in order to interact with files, windows, and other software elements.
    
    Even though the mouse is a peripheral device that sits outside the main computer housing, it's an essential piece of computer hardware in most systems...at least non-touch ones.</p>
    <h3>What does MOUSE stand for?</h3>
    <p>The word mouse stands for a small mammal or a small accessory that enables communication with a computer screen. If you mean, what could it stand for were it an acronym, I'd have to choose Mammal, ordinary, unwanted, smelly, extraneous. It rather depends upon which definition of mouse you are considering as well as your attitudes towards them.</p>
    <h3>What does MOUSE do?</h3>
    <p>
    What Does a Computer Mouse Do? A mouse is an input device that allows people to interact with their computer. The mouse moves the onscreen arrow around the computer's display to point and click on command buttons, menus and icons.
    </p>
    <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of a mouse</h3>
    <p>The mouse is a fastest pointing device in computer system.
    This mouse is relatively cheaper and readily available in the market.
    Batteries are not used in wired mouse and normal mouse.
    The range of wireless mouse is also quite good.
    The mouse pad is not needed or required.
    A mouse can be a multipurpose device it can be connected to laptop as well as to desktop.
    The combination of mouse and keyboards can be used in data entry for better performance.
    They can be easily connected to any devices with USB port.
    They are very efficient and reliable pointing devices, this is considered as the major advantages of mouse therefore easily replaced their counterparts from the market
    The wired mouse cannot be used in long range as the ranges are limited for better connectivity.
    The wired mouse is delicate in nature and must be used carefully as it can be damaged easily.
    If the batteries are low they tend to lose their accuracy and speed.
    They basically work on flat surface.
    Mouse heavily relies on batteries.
    Wireless mouse can sometimes face connectivity issues.
